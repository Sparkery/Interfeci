Interfeci
=========

Console based game with the objective to kill the dragon.

The game uses XOR encryption (the magic number is 12). This is supposed to provide some security, but it is very limited. There will be plans to make the save files more secure.

Save files are created automatically in the same directory as the game, and read automatically when loading a saved game. If the save file becomes corrupt or deleted, there will be varying effects on the game. Do not delete the save file.

The game is very long. Do not delete the save file.
